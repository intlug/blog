# INTLUG is moving

Hello there - thank you for your interest in our local group for Linux interested people around the world.

You're most likely here because you found a link on our old meetup page. Given changes happening on Meetup we've had to look for a new home for the group. For now that's [heylo.co](https://heylo.co). Future meetings will solely be announced there - please join our group there to see what meetings will come, who's the speaker and a lot more.

Join URL: [Heylo group International Linux Users Group](https://heylo.group/international-linux-users-group)

Why the move?  In short, Meetup is not providing enough features for the price they're charging, and their price was just doubled; while they're indicating they'll remove even more features from the base package, and require you to buy into a much larger upsell to get something useful. For our use that's simply not worth it.

As a reminder, we have a mailing list that we can use to communicate outside of our meetings.

While Heylo does have lots of ways to communiate within the group and subgroups, I'm looking into getting a traditional mailing list going.

Should you have unexpected issues using the mailing list, feel free to contact me on ego.alter at gmail dot com.
