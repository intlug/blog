# Radio is everywhere

The sky and space around you is filled with radio signals. Not just the AM/FM radio you may be familiar with, but signals from satellites, ships, planes, ground vehicles and a lot more use radio signals to communicate. Think WiFi before there was Wifi. Airplane transponders communicate it's location, speed, heading, destination and more. Ship transponders like wise include position, heading, destination, cargo type and a lot more. Weather data such as images of earth with cloud coverage are sent out via radio waves. 

John covers a lot of the software that can be used to create software defined radios on Linux, and how to use filter software to decode the signals into understandable data. With that you can make your own "flight-aware" type site, or get a weather report while you're on a hike in the middle of nowhere with no internet connectivity.
