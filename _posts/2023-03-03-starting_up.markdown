# We're live!

After a very well attended and good initial meeting in early February, we wanted to continue running a LUG that reached beyond a single geographical location. We agreed to the following:

* Name of the group is INTLUG
* We have recurring meetings every 2 weeks, switching between a social call and a "topic/presenter" call. 
* Meeting day is Saturday, and time is noon Eastern. We would like to limit the calls to 1 hour particular when we have a presenter.
* We had several topics suggested - see [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/international-linux-users-group/). We need more, but this is a great beginning.

*Our First Meeting*: March 4th! 

It's important to stress that this isn't set in stone. As a group we can make corrections as we find what works and what doesn't.

Topics we plan to have in the near future:

* March 18t: Open Source in Radio Hardware
* April 1st: MicroShift - containers on the edge
* May 20th: Managing wild card certificates for a home lab

There's a long parking lot of interesting topics that still need a speaker and a time.  We'll discuss this at every social call.
