During 2021 and 2022, COVID caused a new experiment to be started - a social call where the subjects where free, very informal and even though Linux wasn't the required topic (odd for a Linux Users Group I know) the talks often ended up covering lots of different aspects related to Linux and open source.

An unexpected result of 2 years of monthly online meetings was finding lots of people attending from outside the Northern Virginia/DC area where members typically came from. We had interest and very good discussions with people from all of the United States, Canada and even Europe had a few very regular people join despite the late hour.  It make sense to continue LUG meetings in a setting allowing for this wide spectrum of participants, but at the same time requests for formal talks, sessions etc. began coming in as the major parts of the COVID-19 lockdowns came to a halt and people wanted to return to "normal". 

The Northern Virginia Users Group that hosted the meeting was originally setup for in-person meetings and to my knowledge that's still it's goal, although for more than a year there has been no meetings scheduled despite having no lockdown requirements and venues are again open. To avoid conflicts, we'll start coordinating the international lug here - but if you live in an area served by a local users group this is not meant to replace going/participating in those calls.

## Survey

In early January a 12 question basic survey was created and shared with the active participants of the old social calls. Here are the raw results of the survey - see below for commentary and suggestions. The survey is anonymous.

In total there are 12 respondants - and the author did not respond to the survey. 

### What should INTLUG cover?

This provided a list of 4 pre selected options and an option to add more options:
* Like the Social Call - chit-chat about everything
* Formal presentations/talks
* Demos - like what companies would show at conferences
* Only Linux related or wider topis like IoT and programming

![What should INTLUG Cover]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/result-what_should_intlug_cover.png)

### How Often

This question is devided into 4 subsections:
* Frequency
* Day of week
* Time
* Length

Due to an unfortunate data-entry error, the same frequency question was asked twice. We'll just cover the first one here.

#### Frequency
A choice between:
* Weekly
* Bi-Weekly
* Bi-weekly with different agendas (social followed by presentations for instance)
* Monthly

![How Often]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/result-how_often_frequency.png)

#### Day of week
A choise of Monday->Sunday. Only one choice allowed.

![Day Of Week]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/result-how_often_day_of_week.png)

#### Time of meeting

The following options were provided:

* Good for all - between 12 and 15 EST
* Good for Americans - between 12 and 19 EST
* Good for US East Coast - between 9 and 19 EST
Respondants could add their own "other" option too.

#### Length
3 options were provided in hours: 1, 2 or 3.

### Content
This was the first of several questions about content.  This is free-text and no suggested options. 

10 Respondents

| Reponse |
| ------- |
|learn new tech stacks and demo|
|group activity|
|General Linux related discussions, presentations, and demos|
|I'd like to learn about new aspects of Linux usage.  New distros or tools.  For a new distro, what does it accomplish that isn't already being done?  For a new tool, what does it do and how does it work?|
|I'd probably lean towards... "our core value is social / people "  .. and the technology is always the "common theme that brings the people together".    An underlying emphasis maybe on "provide the social things that keep the experienced users coming... while never forgetting that the new learners on the call need priority / special handling / focus. "|
|Just a bunch of random stuff that pops into my head  --  topics that show the open source community ( here's some cool stuff on github ) ,  new things coming into linux ( wayland, etc.. ) , old things in linux and how they progressed,   a smattering of programming stuff that is very lite ... i.e. a 15 minute 'intro to programming in c' for newbies,  maybe some retro stuff ,  "heres a specific emulator that i am running on linux",  "as a new user, here's some tools I find myself using in linux.."|
|Cluster, Kubernetes|
|All things opensource /  technology|
|Linux technologies related to Cloud management, Smart Cities, IoT, smart building management|
|learning how to build and make programs in Linux for us that only ever compiled on windows|
|As mentioned above: Specific and targeted migrations from Windows-only solutions to FOSS alternatives (e.g. total migration from Microsoft AD to a Samba-based solution); where FOSS alternatives may not yet exist or an organization refuses to give up their Windows-only software, we could focus on making that run under Wine/Bottles/Crossover; networking in all aspects - running a routing protocol, bonding Ethernet interfaces, differences between tap/tun/loop interfaces and what their functions are, etc.|

### How to help attendees when remote

Some activities are not easily done virtual - such as assisting with a concrete problem. What suggestions do you have to allow the group to help members with issues when lacking physical access?  Again, no suggestions, just freetext.

7 Respondents

| Response |
| -------- |
|breakout groups for live troubleshooting w/screensharing|
|The only real way to do that is for the person with an issue to have an external web cam to share outputs|
|1 Establish a bulletin board where people can post their questions and/or problems. 2 In parallel with the above step, establish a group of people who check the bulletin board periodically and contact the people with problems/questions and attempt to help them one on one. 3 You'd need to provide a mechanism to identify those questions/problems already being addressed, and those already resolved.|
|The feasibility of this approach would rely on having enough qualified people to volunteer to help.  If possible, it should divide problems between those needing Peter level expertise and those mere mortals could address. |
|Helping new users feels important -- but 1) that shouldnt dominate the main discussion and 2) new users are suuuuper hesitant to ask questions in that type of forum.  My gut feeling is that we should prioritize those people ( it feels like they are the most important people to arrive at the meeting... almost like those individuals sales leads ) and try to assist but only in a 1x1 fashion.   Maybe the moderator of the large group could start with "we have Andrew on the call who is going to triage any support questions... "If you are new to linux and have questions, give Andrew a direct message... or speak up here and Andrew will direct message you" .  The moderator can continue to sort of advertise that throughout the meeting.   Andrew can try to help solve directly, or can act as an interface to the larger group, or can delegate the user to someone one the call who may have special knowledge for a 1x1 discussion.|
|Present as much as possible OnLine, Demo whatever is possible |
|make in person event to take care of it|
|Depending on the exact nature of the problem, i.e. whether network connectivity even exists, and the relative skill of the user, there may be several ways to accomplish this. For the lowest common denominator, though, i.e. rudimentary skilled user and no network access, I feel like photos of the screen (via phone cam) are going to be the most universally available way to do this, said photos then shared with an opt-in group email distro. Perhaps a small document write-up could be provided with the best way to accomplish that, e.g. reminder to use landscape mode, warning to close any password managers or personal info showing, how to get things in focus on Android/iPhone, etc. Beyond these basics, I'd also include instructions for how to grab information that will be of use to the support team - how to open a console, commands to run, how to roll the output into a single text file and/or compressed file, and so forth.|
|Another possibility is to boot from a live image that contains remote access software, mount the local drive(s), and pull the logs and .conf files that way. Maybe even chroot into the local instance...?|

### Proposed name
Open Answer - INTLUG which was the name used to create the meetup page and this survey is a working title only.

6 Respondents

| Response |
| -------- |
|All Things Linux Users Group|
|INTLUG|
|I like INTLUG|
|Is 'international' really the focus?   Maybe something like "VIRTLUG_ENGLISH", or "VIRTLUG_AMERICAS" |
|INT Linux Users Group (spelled out).|
|Greater Universal LUG? GULUG? :D|

### Should presentations be recorded and published?
Yes/No answer.

![Record Sessions]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/result-record-sessions.png)

### Topics of interest
We ask respondents what topics interest them - what would want them to join a formal presentation. 
8 Repondants - all freetext, no suggestions.

| Response |
| -------- |
|Big data and ML AI|
|Document management, home knowledge base|
|Comparisons and overviews of competing tech like package managers, desktop environments, distros.  Linux in consumer tech like Steam Deck.  New and emerging tech like immutable OSes (e.g. Fedora Silverblue).  Good distros, software, and tool to get non-technical people using Linux comfortably on the desktop.|
|1 Impacts of the switch from HDDs to NVMe or other solid state storage. 2 Real world examples of Linux being used in an office or business wide network using domain level authentication similar to Microsoft's Active Directory.|
|I love to hear people's stories... their history... how they grew up with tech... how their careers progressed... challenges they had with tech ... challenges they had with people... different organization structures / styles they encountered... how Linux / open source played a part in those things.   I feel like many people don't talk because doing a 'presentation about a technical thing' is a lot of work.  Instead of asking for presenters... we might be able to just ask for "who wants to tell your career story and intersperse it with a few technical bits along the way" ( might be a way to can-opener some of these hesitant personalities )|
|Linux using on the enterprise environment|
|compliing. understanding linux architecture, logs,|
|Cybersecurity and everything that entails: firewalls (network and host based), IDS/IPS, certificates and why they matter, VPNs, disk encryption.|

### Topics offered as speaker
This last question tries to gauage what knowledge and interest the group would have early on. For volunteer groups, those who volunteer set the agenda.

4 Respondents

| Response |
| -------- |
|Directory Structure, is it even necessary? (see [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueJbrLqsYsI&t=3879s)), [DreamOSPaper](https://okmij.org/ftp/papers/DreamOSPaper.html)|
|No one would want to hear something simple enough for me to present it.|
|I want to talk about things that would help new users over their hurdles and help these users orient themselves in productive directions of learning.  That's pretty vague... I'm still thinking about it.|
|Best tactics for approaching a company, enterprise, or customer about a full migration away from proprietary software. Everything from how would you sell the idea to someone who's only ever worked with Windows and Microsoft Office, to how you would implement such a radical switch. What distro would you use for the desktops vs. servers? How would you manage them, both in terms of software patching, and also enforcing policies? What software would you recommend to accomplish a given task? How would you approach any proprietary, custom, or just plain ancient software they require?|

## Preliminary comments

Given this is a new group with less than 100 people signed up for now, the number of responses is very high and suggests there would be a foundation to try this out.

The wast majority would like to continue a broader approach that isn't just US east coast time-based although there doesn't seem to be consensus on what day of week it should be done at. There's a majority who just wants monthly meeting and a large miniority who wants weekly. It needs to be stressed that finding speakers for weekly meetings is going to be impossible, so any frequency outside of monthly would be the usual social call meetings. If we want to go with very frequent calls, we'll need a second organizer because there will definitely be conflicts with personal and work schedules if it's too frequent. 

The kind of meetings wanted seems to clearly favor the traditonal presentation that LUGs typically have. A person with interest/knowledge of a certain area presents on this topic asking for input. This format also allows for professional speakers, like community leaders, to present using their normal materials.  It's however interesting that the social aspect, what could be named as the networking opportunity, is also favored by 50%. From this I think 2 meetings monthly where one would be social(chit chat) and the other would be a formal presentation would work.

As for content we have relative beginner topics and advanced ones. A wide spectrum which is expected given how wide the net is cast. I think going forward it will be important to keep the talks mixed, so they're not all for beginners, and not all advanced. A potential way around this is to have more than one talk at each meeting (like lightning talks) which doesn't require as much preparation time to do. Regardless, this would be fluent as the group grows and would depend on who attends and who wants to speak.

# Final notes
This is very new - nothing is set in stone. This site is created using GitHub Pages and Jekyll and anyone who wants to can contribute - each memeber can even have their own static web-site using simple markup language.  If you're interested in helping, that would REALLY help - let me know and I can add you. For now, you see the source and content of the github, go to https://github.com/intlug

You can easily be added to this organization as a contributor which will allow you to create repositories and help out.  This site would be used to hold records of meetings and our ideas going forward, giving new potential members a forum. A discussion group was added to the github too allowing for in-writing discussions. Other options can absolutely be added/used - these are not meant as "must haves" just as examples.

Remember to sign up for our first meeting on meetup: https://www.meetup.com/international-linux-users-group/events/291152641/

We're using google meet for now - we can absolutely change this to something else if someone is willing to organize it. 

Posts containing our topics/speakers to help scheduling will come soon (after our initial meeting).
